As a molecular information company, we are focused on fundamentally changing the way in which patients with cancer are treated. Our products provide more than information. They offer hope to patients, their families and friends, their physicians and caregivers.  As a member of the Foundation Medicine team you’ll work with everyone fighting the disease—patients and their families, payers, physicians, drug developers—to raise awareness about this transformation in cancer care and Foundation Medicine’s role to ensure we’re delivering the tools and information they need to make an impact and drive access for patients everywhere.  Headquartered in the heart of Cambridge, MA, with an additional testing site located in Research Triangle Park, NC, we offer competitive salaries, generous benefits and with our rapid growth, ample career opportunities. What makes Foundation Medicine so special? The cancer treatment paradigm is evolving rapidly, and we believe there is now widespread recognition that cancer is a disease of the genome, rather than a disease defined solely by its specific anatomical location in the body. Today, physicians increasingly use precision medicines to target cancers based on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth, but most currently available molecular diagnostic tests only reveal a few of the possible alterations. Foundation Medicine provides truly comprehensive molecular information products that can assess the broadest range of relevant genomic alterations from a patient’s tumor and distill this complex molecular information into a concise and actionable format that reveals more treatment options for physicians and their patients.  We've seen the difference that our technology can make in the lives of patients, but there is still enormous potential to help even more people. In our drive to help transform the way in which patients with cancer are treated, we strive to improve every life we touch through our dedication to innovation, our commitment to people, and our passion for performance.

Read on to learn more about us, our take on Data Science, the gig, and how to apply! About ByteCubed Not so long ago, ByteCubed was a small DC startup founded on the premise that the contracting space was fundamentally broken -- as many of us in the DC area know, contracts can be bloated, expensive, and inflexible things, often claiming to provide innovative cure-alls while in fact relying on dated technology stacks. As developers supporting those contracts, we worked in the dark, many degrees of remove from the feedback we needed, and our clients often waited years to see any of the fruits of our labor.  Bytecubed is designed to be different - and while were a slightly bigger and more established company now, with a team of about 140 and more than a few awards under our belt, we remain true to the principle that contracts can be lean, agile, focused, innovative, AND profitable enough to keep the lights on and the kids fed. About this job People use the words data science to mean a lot of different things. At Bytecubed, the data science team mostly does data wrangling, natural language processing, and machine learning. We work with a lot of different kinds of data: unstructured text from the wild web, relational datasets from commercial providers, semi-structured data from public APIs. On a practical level, whether were working with social media data or corporate entity data, were generally looking for ways to make it easier for client-side folks to do what they already do -- look up data, draw connections, anticipate shifts and changes, make hard business decisions -- but make it faster, easier, smarter, and more scalable. We leverage libraries from Python and R, tools like Spark and Hadoop, and a range of different SQL and noSQL databases to do that, though were fairly open-minded in terms of stack (well, we do have a strong preference for open source). Who were looking forFirst off, youre a U.S. Citizen and able to work in the U.S. (sorry - this one is non-negotiable because of the contracts we work on). It would be great if you are in the DC/MD/VA commuting area, but we can make a remote thing work if necessary.You have a lot of experience working with data, and youre comfortable with structured and unstructured data (HTML, XML, JSON, CSV).You dont have a dog in the SQL/noSQL fight -- you believe in picking the best tool for the job, and youve used enough of both to have good instincts about what will work best to solve the problem at hand.Youve been doing object-oriented programming for a while (4+ years), and you know Python/R well enough to hit the ground running on Day One.You have a grasp of machine learning and youre game to help us find smart ways to implement/integrate data science features (e.g. machine learning models) within a Java- and Angular-based software application.You have experience with agile software development, know about sprints, scrum, and all that stuff, and you arent squeamish about code reviews or rubber ducking.You understand why version control is important to data science and are willing to using git branching conventions in a routine, methodical, communicative, and participatory way.Things that are not important to us, But nice to have A PhD or some other advanced degree. If you have one, thats cool (some of us do, too). Other fancy credentials, certificates, badges, HackerRank or Kaggle scores, etc. Your ability to implement a binary search tree or fizzbuzz on a whiteboard while an interviewer stands behind you. Being full stack - yes, experience with a range of tools is nice, but were more interested in depth than breadth. A GitHub profile commit calendar thats lit up like a Christmas tree. We would like to hear about the projects youve worked on in the past, but we understand if they arent open source. (Also, if you come work with us, you will have an opportunity to work on open source projects.) Working at the office 5 days a week, within an arbitrarily fixed time range every day. Your current or past job titles.How to apply and what to expectPlease send an email with a paragraph or two about yourself and why youre interested in this job, along with a link to a publicly-viewable LinkedIn profile or resume. Please use thoughtful, conversational English and proof-read your message. Additionally, please briefly describe one or two projects or products youve worked on recently for work, fun, or any other reason. Include the capacity you worked on the project and challenges you faced. (Links to code or live versions are great, but we understand if thats not possible.)If we choose to move forward well invite you to a 30-60 minute phone screen so you can learn more about ByteCubed and this role and we can learn more about you. About half of this call will be dedicated to your questions for us, so you can begin to evaluate if this job might be a good fit for you and if you want to invest more time in this process.If that goes well, well give you an at-home coding exercise that involves reading and refactoring some code.A half-day of in-person interviews. These will build on the code base from the last step. Well do a collaborative code review, brainstorm next steps, and do some pair programming together. You will also have an opportunity to meet a range of folks from our company, and will have ample time to ask us all questions.After each stage well let you know whether or not wed like to continue as quickly as possible. If youre advancing to the next stage, we may also give you feedback about what we thought you did well and what you could improve on for the next round.

Working for multiple clients in multiple domains demands adaptive improvisation, and lust for discovering new insight. Benefits The requirements are the benefits. We have healthy compensation packages competitive with industry standards, and you'll be very well taken care of.

Based on that performance we automatically re-balance budget across the best performing combination.Prediction and forecasting:Our advertisers want to know how many people will see their ad and at what price before they finalize their strategy. For one of our ads to be shown, it likely has to participate in up to 3 different auctions. Can we predict with confidence how often we will win those auctions and at what price? How does that vary based on external market demands?Experimental design:How do we measure the impact of any changes we introduce to our optimization models? How do we quantify any tradeoffs those models may introduce (e.g., you pay more for each ad impression, but each impression is more valuable).Causal inference:How do we determine what ads are performing best?

The successful  candidate will lead and conduct end-user-focused research as a part of the  NSSL’s Warn-on-Forecast (WoF) program, and in doing so, serve as the  Warn-on-Forecast liaison between NSSL and the broader NOAA National Weather  Service (NWS) community. Background: The vision of the  WoF program is to develop, test, and transition to operations a probabilistic  storm-scale forecast system with the goal of providing continuous forecast  guidance between the ‘watch-to-warning’ temporal and spatial scales for  hazardous convective weather such as tornadoes, large hail, damaging winds, and  extreme rainfall. An experimental WoF system has recently been developed and is  early in its testing phase.  It is important  that the probabilistic forecast guidance provided by the system is usable and  useful to NWS forecasters and other stakeholders, like broadcast  meteorologists, emergency managers, and others. Social science research  engaging forecasters at operational WFO and other locations is needed to  determine the feasibility of transitioning a WoF system to operations.  Currently we are working mostly with the Norman, OK WFO to test the system’s  usability in an operational environment.  We are looking  for a social scientist interested in expanding the breadth and depth of  research-to-operations studies that engage users at multiple NWS offices and  centers. In particular, we are looking for a social scientist with experience  designing and conducting end-to-end research studies, ideally within the  weather enterprise. These studies will  be aimed at addressing research questions such as: What spatio-temporal  information gaps are most challenging in the generation and delivery of  forecasts? What are forecasters’ baseline interpretations of probabilistic  forecast guidance from ensemble systems? What types of tools, products, and  visualizations are best for the interpretation and use of rapidly updating  probabilistic forecast guidance? Methods for examining these types of questions  may include usability testing experiments, surveys, interviews, focus groups,  and/or observational studies with both forecasters and end-users (i.e.,  broadcast meteorologists and emergency managers). Results from these studies  will provide feedback on how to enhance usability of the WoF system that will  then be used to improve system development. Responsibilities: The incumbent will design and conduct studies within  NOAA NWS offices and centers to explore and test operational usability of the  WoF system. This work will include  aspects such as: 1) visualization of system output, 2) forecasters’  perceptions, understanding, and use of probabilistic forecast guidance and  related uncertainty information, 3) the communication of this information to  partners, and 4) identification of operational opportunities for (or concerns about)  applying probabilistic information within the WFO and broader NWS  infrastructure.  In this role, a primary responsibility of the  incumbent will be to coordinate the experimental use of the WoF system with NWS  leaders. This responsibility includes  traveling to and conducting research within NWS offices and centers as needed.  Throughout the research process, the incumbent will collaborate with other  social scientists, model developers, and stakeholders to contribute toward the  production of a WoF system prototype ready for transfer to operations.  Additional responsibilities include publishing findings in peer-reviewed  literature and presenting at conferences.

We have a rich blend of NIH, NHTSA, SAMHSA and Foundation funded work focusing on various drugs of abuse, including prescription drugs, marijuana, heroin, methamphetamine and related health and public health problems (e.g. HIV, HCV, overdose, driving fatalities, criminology). We are specifically expanding our drug related research but are not limiting this opportunity. Our scientists examine risk factors and outcomes at both the individual and structural levels, with a focus on informing public policy and/or understanding the specific impacts of policies on health. Our studies employ a diverse range of research methodologies, including qualitative and quantitative methods and a variety of innovative sampling methods. Among these studies are NHTSA- and NIH-funded roadside surveys that are measuring the prevalence of drug use among drivers using biological measures, the effects of marijuana legalization on prevalence among drivers, and the effects of drugs on crash risk.  Anchoring our research portfolio on the west coast is the Prevention Research Center (PRC) in Oakland, CA. PRC is one of 27 centers sponsored by the NIAAA. PRC was formed in 1983 and is the only such center that specializes in the environmental prevention. PRC's focus is on conducting research to understand better the social and physical environments that influence individual behavior that leads to alcohol and drug misuse. Recent PRC drug research includes studies of the geographical distribution of medical marijuana dispensaries as well as effects of decriminalization and legalization of marijuana.  Details of our other Centers can be found at www.pire.org.  PIRE has a strong commitment to research dissemination and moving science to practice and practice to science. The implementation of our work is demonstrated in peer-reviewed journal articles, reports for government and lay audiences and professional presentations. Fuller documentation of PIRE’s corporate capabilities detailing our drug-related work is on our web site (www.pire.org).  We look forward to talking with you about your interests and the fit with PIRE.","Investigator - Senior Research Scientist"," 4.2"," Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation"," – Louisville, KY","$104,000/ year","1137724"
